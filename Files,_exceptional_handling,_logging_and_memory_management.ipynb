        "Here are the answers to the questions listed in the image:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Interpreted languages execute code line by line, while compiled languages convert the entire code to machine code before execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is exception handling in Python?**  \n",
        "  Ans :- Exception handling is a way to manage errors gracefully during runtime using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- The `finally` block is executed no matter what, ensuring resources are released (e.g., closing files).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **What is logging in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Logging allows tracking events in an application, providing a record of runtime activities for debugging and monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- `__del__` is a destructor method called when an object is deleted or garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- `import` imports the entire module, while `from ... import` imports specific functions or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Use multiple `except` blocks or handle multiple exceptions in a single block using tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- `with` ensures proper resource management by automatically closing files after the block executes.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Multithreading runs threads within the same process, sharing memory. Multiprocessing runs processes independently, with separate memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Logging helps in debugging, error tracking, and auditing by providing records of program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is memory management in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Python uses dynamic memory allocation and garbage collection to manage memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Use `try` to wrap code, `except` to handle exceptions, `else` for successful execution, and `finally` to clean up resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Why is memory management important in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Proper memory management ensures optimal performance and avoids memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **What is the role of try and except in exception handling?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- `try` contains code that might raise an exception, and `except` handles the exception if one occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **How does Python's garbage collection system work?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Python uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection to reclaim unused memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- The `else` block executes if no exceptions occur in the `try` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **What are the common logging levels in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- `os.fork()` creates a child process at the OS level, while `multiprocessing` abstracts process creation in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Closing a file ensures data is written properly and prevents resource leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- `file.read()` reads the entire file, while `file.readline()` reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **What is the logging module in Python used for?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- It provides a flexible framework for creating and managing logs.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- The `os` module provides methods to interact with the operating system (e.g., file manipulation).\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Reference cycles, fragmentation, and high memory usage for large applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. **How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Use the `raise` keyword followed by the exception type.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. **Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**  \n",
        "   Ans :- Multithreading improves performance in I/O-bound tasks by running multiple operations concurrently."
